        <h1>Martina Fischmeister *1995</h1>
        <p>


Martina is a czech illustrator and painter, residing and working in Prague.

She finished her degree at Art{"&"}Design Institut, under guidance of doc. Roman Franta and prof. Jiří Lindovský.

She is profesionally making book and editorial illustration but she also enjoys doing comics, tattoo design and oilpainting.

Her illustrations are regularly being published in newspaper Právo, magazine Salon and also in books on the czech and english market.


For the work of Martina Fischmeister the most suitable words are „cool digital“.
Her illustrations definetly represent a trend in the contemporary czech illustration: please note the juicy colours that seem to shine out of the digital monitors as well as magazine‘s pages.
Martina has a sovereign drawing and confident treatment of brushes.
She is clearly very comfortable with drawing the most dreaded thing between illustrators – the human figure and the human face.
In her illustration she cuts them, sinks them under different kinds of liquids and uses interesting lighting. She is a media freerider and her style suits well to different comissions.
