        Hi, I'm a freelance illustrator and artist from Prague, Czechia. In my
        illustration I like to work with color and movement, relationship
        between shapes and the complexity of balancing story with picture.
        Outside of illustrative work I devote myself to comics and traditional
        painting.

        If you want to hire me, have questions or just say want to say hi, feel
        free to contact me!
